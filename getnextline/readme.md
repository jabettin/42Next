## Description ##
>GNL is a function that reads from a file descriptor and returns one line at a time.
It continuously reads input in chunks of `BUFFER_SIZE` until a `newline character` or *`\n`* is found or when `EOF` (End-Of-File) is reached.
When GNL encounters a newline character, the function extracts the line up to and including that newline character, and stores the remaining data for the next function call.
So, on every new call to `get_next_line`, the function resumes reading from the remaining stored data and stops only when the EOF is reached and the buffer no longer contains any characters.
This GNL does **NOT** contain the bonus excercise


## Instructions ##
>The compiling will happen with the three standard flags, -Wall -Wextra -Werror and is typed as follows:
`cc -Werror -Wall -Wextra ./main.c ./get_next_line.c ./get_next_line_utils.c -D BUFFER_SIZE=4 -o test`
After which it can be ran using **./test**.



## Resources ##
For this project i used the information by 
- [LAnnur-s from the website Medium.](https://medium.com/@lannur-s/gnl-c3cff1ee552b)
I also used valgrind and francinette for testing purposes, and to look for any memory leaks.
Furthermore, i used AI to write the flow of my GNL down below, and i must admit, it did a pretty good job of explaining the flow of GNL.

## GNL main code snippet ##
```C
char	*get_next_line(int fd)
{
	static char	*remainder;
	char		*buffer;
	ssize_t		bytes_read;

	if (fd < 0 || BUFFER_SIZE <= 0)
		return (NULL);
	buffer = malloc(BUFFER_SIZE + 1);
	if (!buffer)
		return (NULL);
	bytes_read = 1;
	while (bytes_read > 0 && (!remainder || !ft_strchr(remainder, '\n')))
	{
		bytes_read = read(fd, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE);
		if (bytes_read < 0)
			return (free(buffer), free(remainder), remainder = NULL, NULL);
		buffer[bytes_read] = '\0';
		remainder = join_free(remainder, buffer);
		if (!remainder)
			return (free(buffer), remainder = NULL, NULL);
	}
	free(buffer);
	if (!remainder || !*remainder)
		return (free(remainder), remainder = NULL, NULL);
	return (extract_line(&remainder));
}
```



## Flow of GNL ##
You call `get_next_line(fd)` for the first time with the string "Hello\nWorld\n42":

1. **Initial Setup**

   * A **static pointer `remainder`** is declared. Right now, it’s `NULL`.
   * A **buffer** of size `BUFFER_SIZE + 1` (5 bytes) is allocated to store data read from the file.
   * `bytes_read` is set to 1 so we can enter the read loop.

---

2. **First Read (first 4 bytes)**

   * `read(fd, buffer, 4)` reads `"hell"` from the file.
   * `buffer[4] = '\0'` → buffer is now `"hell"`.
   * `join_free(remainder, buffer)` is called:

     * `remainder` is `NULL`, so only `buffer` is copied.
     * A new string `"hell"` is allocated and returned.
     * `remainder` now points to `"hell"`.
     * `buffer` is freed inside `join_free`.
   * **Check for newline**: `ft_strchr(remainder, '\n')` → no newline yet.
   * Loop continues.

3. **Second Read (next 4 bytes)**

   * `read(fd, buffer, 4)` reads `"o\nWo"`.
   * `buffer[4] = '\0'` → buffer is `"o\nWo"`.
   * `join_free(remainder, buffer)` is called:

     * `remainder` is `"hell"`, `buffer` is `"o\nWo"`.
     * A new string `"hello\nWo"` is allocated.
     * `remainder` is updated to point to `"hello\nWo"`.
     * `buffer` is freed.
   * **Check for newline**: `ft_strchr(remainder, '\n')` → newline found at index 5 (`"hello\n"`).
   * Loop exits.

4. **Extract the Line**

   * `extract_line(&remainder)` is called.
   * `nl_ptr = ft_strchr(remainder, '\n')` → points to the `\n` in `"hello\nWo"`.
   * `len = nl_ptr - *remainder + 1 = 5 - 0 + 1 = 6` → we want 6 characters including newline.
   * `line = ft_substr(remainder, 0, 6)` → line is `"hello\n"`.
   * `update_remainder(remainder, 6)` is called:

     * `old = "hello\nWo"`, `start = 6`.
     * `old[6]` is `'W'` → not null.
     * `ft_substr(old, 6, ft_strlen(old) - 6)` → substring from index 6 to end → `"Wo"`.
     * `remainder` is updated to `"Wo"`.
   * Return `"hello\n"` from `get_next_line`.

5. **Second Call to `get_next_line(fd)`**

   * `remainder = "Wo"` from previous call.
   * Buffer is allocated again.
   * `read(fd, buffer, 4)` → reads `"rld\n"` (next 4 bytes).
   * `buffer[4] = '\0'` → buffer is `"rld\n"`.
   * `join_free(remainder, buffer)` → `"Wo"` + `"rld\n"` → `"World\n"`.
   * Check for newline → found at index 5.
   * `extract_line(&remainder)`:

     * `len = 6` → `"World\n"` is extracted.
     * `update_remainder("World\n", 6)` → nothing left → remainder = `NULL`.
   * Return `"World\n"`.

6. **Third Call to `get_next_line(fd)`**

   * `remainder = NULL`.
   * `read(fd, buffer, 4)` → reads `"42"` (last bytes).
   * `buffer[2] = '\0'` → buffer = `"42"`.
   * `join_free(remainder, buffer)` → remainder = `"42"`.
   * Check for newline → not found.
   * `read(fd, buffer, 4)` → returns 0 (EOF).
   * `extract_line(&remainder)`:

     * No newline, copy entire remainder → `"42"`.
     * Free remainder → remainder = `NULL`.
   * Return `"42"`.

7. **Fourth Call to `get_next_line(fd)`**

   * `remainder = NULL`.
   * `read(fd, buffer, 4)` → returns 0 (EOF).
   * `get_next_line` returns `NULL` → end of file reached.



## Key concepts/syntax of this GNL project ##

* **`buffer`**: Temporary array where each chunk of the file is read. Freed after each iteration.
* **`remainder`**: Persistent storage across calls, holds data that was read but not yet returned as a line.
* **`nl_ptr`**: Pointer inside `remainder` to the first occurrence of `\n`.
* **`extract_line`**: Takes a line from `remainder` up to and including `\n`, updates remainder to only leftover data.
* **`update_remainder`**: Removes the extracted part from `remainder`.
* **Static `remainder`**: Enables `get_next_line` to “remember” leftover data between multiple calls.
